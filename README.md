This project analyzes road accident data to identify major causes, trends, and patterns related to accidents. The goal is to gain insights that can help reduce accidents and improve road safety through data analysis and visualization.

**Dataset**

The dataset contains information about road accidents such as:

Accident severity

Vehicle type

Road conditions

Weather conditions

Time and location

The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed using Python.

**Objectives**

Analyze trends in road accidents across time and locations.

Identify factors affecting accident severity.

Visualize accident hotspots and high-risk conditions.

Derive insights to recommend safety improvements.

**Tools & Libraries Used**

Python

Pandas – for data cleaning and analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for data visualization

NumPy – for numerical operations

Jupyter Notebook – for development and presentation

**Key Insights**

Accidents are most frequent during weekends and late-night hours.

Weather conditions and road types have a significant impact on severity.

Certain regions show higher accident densities.
